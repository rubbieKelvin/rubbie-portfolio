      This portfolio uses a minimalistic, text-focused design inspired by old
      typewritten newspapers and
      <a href="https://p5aholic.me/" class="underline" target="_blank"
        >Keita Yamada</a
      >'s clean aesthetic. The goal is to keep things simple, clear, and focused
      on content. I believe good design doesn't need to be flashy, it should be
      functional, intentional, and easy to navigate. This approach reflects my
      preference for substance over unnecessary style.

        Copycats Inspiration drives creativity, I've refined my skills by
        learning from the work of others, and I welcome anyone who finds value
        in what I create. However, there's a clear line between drawing
        inspiration and outright copying. Blatantly replicating and claiming
        someone else's work as your own is unacceptable. If you come across any
