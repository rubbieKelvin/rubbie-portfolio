Oh... ðŸ™‚, you're here. I guess you're just learning to code (welcome to the alternate universe) or you already learned to code but skipped a lot of the boring parts. Well, you're here, so how about I take you far back, as early as `print()`?

In this article, I'll be taking you through Python's inbuilt function `print()`, and also a bunch of stuff that'll be useful as you continue your journey in this universe.

## What you'll learn

- Hello world in Python
- Printing multiple statements
- The `print`'s `sep` keyword
- The `print`'s `end` keyword
- Packing and Unpacking
- Suppressing the print function

## "Hello, World!"

If you started your programming journey from tutorials or an article like this, *Hello, World!* must have been your first program (it wasn't for me...).

A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World". In Python, it'll be written like this:

```python
print("Hello, world")
```

We wouldn't really be focusing on the basics, so let's get down to business.

## Printing Multiple Objects

The `print` function is used to print Python objects to the console. There might be cases where we would need to print multiple objects to the screen. All we need to do is add multiple arguments to the `print` function, and we'll get a clean result.

```python
is_active = True
name = "Harry Potter"
language = "JavaScript"

print("rubbie knows", language)
print(name, "is active:", is_active)
print("hello, world.", "my name is Rubbie")

# Unpopular opinion:
print("hello, world." + " my name is Rubbie")
```

Someone from the crowd: *"what's the difference between `print('hello, world.', 'my name is Rubbie')` and `print('hello, world.' + ' my name is Rubbie')`?"*

Okay... looks like I just got a question ðŸ˜‚. In the first example, we're actually printing two string arguments, which are automatically separated by a whitespace once printed.

In the second example, we're printing a single string argument. Both strings are just added together in the `print` function's parentheses. This produces the same results but may not work so well on other data types aside from strings.

```python
# you can't add a string and an integer
print("i am" + 6)  # --> TypeError

# both lines produce different results
print(5, 5)  # --> 5 5
print(5 + 5)  # --> 10
```

## Separating Arguments with the `sep` Keyword Argument

If we were to write a story using multiple `print` statements, we'd want to preserve newlines:

```python
print("Rubbie woke up in the morning.")
print("He took his dog down the street for a walk.")
print("Few minutes later, he came back home.")
print("The end.")
```

If we wanted to write this same story with one `print` statement and still preserve the new lines, we'd pass `"\n"` to the `sep` keyword argument.

```python
print(
    "Rubbie woke up in the morning.",
    "He took his dog down the street for a walk.",
    "Few minutes later, he came back home.",
    "The end.",
    sep="\n"
)
```

### Other examples:

```python
print("hello", "world", sep=",")  # result: hello,world
print(3, 5, sep="*")  # result: 3*5
```

---

## The `print` Function's `end` Keyword

By default, when we use the `print` statement, it ends with a newline, making the next text appear below it.

```python
print("hello")
print("world")
```

**Outputs:**

```
hello
world
```

To make the next printed statement start next to the previous line, we can pass a value to the `end` keyword argument.

```python
print("hello", end=" ")
print("world")
# result: hello world
```

---

## Packing and Unpacking

This part isn't only common to the `print` functionâ€”arguments and keyword arguments can be packed into other functions too, but I thought I shouldn't leave this out.

Instead of looping through a list to print each element, we can unpack the list directly in `print`:

```python
days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thur", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
print(*days, sep=", ")
```

### Practical Example:

```python
name = "rubbie kelvin"
languages = ["python", "javascript", "c++"]

print(name, "can write in", end=" ")
print(*languages, sep=", ")
```

```python
def inclinedplane(char, height):
    char = char[0]  # we need only one character
    return [char * i for i in range(1, height + 1)]

result = inclinedplane("*", 10)
print(*result, sep="\n")
```

## Suppressing the `print` Function

The `print` function is a good debugging tool, but sometimes, we may want to remove all print statements. Instead of manually deleting them, we can disable the `print` function by overwriting the standard output.

```python
import sys, os

def disable_print():
    sys.stdout = open(os.devnull, 'w')

def enable_print():
    sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__

print("this will be printed on console")
disable_print()
print("this wouldn't be printed")
enable_print()
print("re: this will be printed on console")
```
