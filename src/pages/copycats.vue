        Copycats Inspiration drives creativity, I've refined my skills by
        learning from the work of others, and I welcome anyone who finds value
        in what I create. However, there's a clear line between drawing
        inspiration and outright copying. Blatantly replicating and claiming
        someone else's work as your own is unacceptable. If you come across any
