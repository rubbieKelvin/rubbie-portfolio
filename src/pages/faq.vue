      This portfolio embraces a minimalistic, text-focused design inspired by
      the timeless elegance of old typewritten newspapers and the clean
      aesthetic of
      <a href="https://p5aholic.me/" class="underline">Keita Yamada</a>'s work.
      I wanted to create a space that prioritizes content over embellishments,
      where every word and detail is intentional. The simplicity isn't just a
      design choice, it reflects my belief in clarity, focus, and functionality.
      It's also a nod to an era when design was as much about restraint as it
      was about creativity. By stripping away excess, this portfolio serves as a
      reminder that substance always outweighs style, and that good design
      doesn't need to shout... it speaks clearly and confidently -

        Copycats Inspiration drives creativity, I've refined my skills by
        learning from the work of others, and I welcome anyone who finds value
        in what I create. However, there's a clear line between drawing
        inspiration and outright copying. Blatantly replicating and claiming
        someone else's work as your own is unacceptable. If you come across any
